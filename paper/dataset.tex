\section{Datasets preprocessing}\label{sect:dataset}
Two are the datasets considered in this paper to test the proposed approach.
The first one is the \textit{WikiSmall} dataset \cite{D17-1063}, 
while the second one is the \textit{WikiLarge} dataset \cite{D17-1063}. \\
Both of them have a structure made of a source, complex phrase and a target, simpler sentence.
The idea to train an \textit{auto-regressive transformer} on these corpora calls for a preprocessing step.
It would be useless to clean the datasets from stopwords, since they in this case give context to the sentence.
What can be done, instead, is to pair the source and target sentences in a single line, 
separated by a token signaling the end of the complex phrase and the beginning of the simplified sentence.
